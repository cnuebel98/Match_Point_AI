        # 1. Tree selection phase with UCT Formular:

        # UCT = (wi/si) + c * sqrt(ln(sp)/si)

        # si ... current nodes total number of simulations
        # sp ... parent node's current number of simulations
        # c  ... exploration parameter, usually sprt(2)

        # (wi/si) ... exploitation term (gets larger, the better the 
        # node has performed)
        
        # sqrt(ln(sp)/si) ... exploration term (gets larger, when the 
        # node is picked less and less for simulation)
        
        # My plan: 
        # - gets the current tree and the active node in that tree

        # - here we start the selection phase: from that active node we 
        # look at the next possible actions. If there is any action, 
        # that has not yet been played, the selection phase is stopped 
        # and one or more of them is expanded 
        
        # - when its a serve, the Agent can choose the hit in directions 4, 5, 6
        # - when its in the ralley, the Agent can choose to hit in directions 1, 2, 3
        # - 
        
        # 2. Expansion phase
